    "A 3-vector (SEO articles, publication data, and DP style guide) retrieval augmented generation-based AI system is a type of language model that combines the strengths of traditional language generation with the power of retrieval-based methods. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Retrieval**: This module is responsible for retrieving relevant vectors ( dense numerical representations) from a large database or knowledge base.\n",
    "2. **Generation**: This module is a traditional language generation model, such as a transformer-based architecture (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).\n",
    "3. **Augmentation**: This module combines the output from the retrieval and generation modules to produce the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Input and Embedding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The system receives an input prompt or query, which is converted into a numerical representation (embedding) using a technique like word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Vector Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input embedding is used to query a large database or knowledge base, which contains a massive collection of vectors. These vectors represent various pieces of text, such as sentences, paragraphs, or articles.\n",
    "* The retrieval module uses a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product) to find the top-N most similar vectors to the input embedding. These vectors are retrieved from the database and passed to the next module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The generation module is a traditional language generation model, which takes the input embedding as input and generates a response. This response is typically a sequence of tokens (e.g., words, characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Augmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The augmentation module combines the retrieved vectors from Step 2 with the generated response from Step 3.\n",
    "* The retrieved vectors are used to augment the generated response by adding relevant information, such as specific details, examples, or context. This is done by fusing the vectors with the generated response using techniques like vector concatenation, attention mechanisms, or pointer networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final response is produced by the augmentation module, which incorporates the relevant information from the retrieved vectors into the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved accuracy**: By incorporating relevant information from the knowledge base, the system can generate more accurate and informative responses.\n",
    "* **Increased diversity**: The retrieval module can provide diverse perspectives and examples, which can enhance the overall quality of the generated response.\n",
    "* **Efficient use of knowledge**: The system can leverage a large knowledge base without having to generate responses from scratch, making it more efficient and scalable."

    "* The model is trained on a large dataset of text and is capable of generating high-quality, coherent text that meets the company's writing style and SEO optimization guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Post-processing and Ranking**\n",

    "        + Filter out low-quality or irrelevant suggestions\n",

    "**Step 5: Output and Integration**\n",
