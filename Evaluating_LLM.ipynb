    "# Pros + Cons of Claude 3 Opus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros\n",
    "- Follows the prompt template very accurately\n",
    "- Doesn't generate fake content/articles\n",
    "- Ease of use\n",
    "- Accessibility through API rather than Ollama\n",
    "- Fast response time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons \n",
    "- Unsure if it is fully utilizing the contexts (other models specifically reference other DP articles)\n",
    "- Sometimes the titles are lackluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I am very impressed with the Opus model. It gives very good outputs that are accurate and hasn't hallucinated any outputs. It sticks to the prompt template very well. In the future, I would like to test its ability to recall and reference previous articles and their associated metrics. But overall, I am very happy with the Claude 3 Opus model!"
