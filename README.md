# DP SEO TOOL, COMM4190 Final Project

## An A.I. Promotional Assistant for Writers at The Daily Pennsylvanian by Jason Saito and Sean McKeown

# Introduction 

During the spring 2024 semester, we have spent countless hours discussing, researching, and developing potential future uses that Artificial Intelligence, or Large Language Modles, may provide. With the constantly expanding state of the field, its hard to decide on only one particular idea to focus on for our final project. With infinite possibilities comes infinite potential decisions to make in regards to creating our own A.I. agent. That said, we have found a particular niche inside of our shared extracurricular of working for The Daily Pennsylvanian. When publishing articles, it is important to find a balance between journalistic integrity and marketability. For that reason, we are happy to present the DP's first A.I. based SEO (search engine optimization) analytics tool that will help in finding that exact balance.

# Outline of the usefulness of DP-SEO's capabilties.

In a world of click bait and misinformation, A.I. has become a great tool to help analyze interaction based analytics in combination with writing style to best find the theoretical "sweet spot" in which journalistic integrity is upheld while creating the most market-viable product. Since the dawn of the internet, journalistic enterprise has changed rapidly. The long forgotten era of in-print or hot-off-the-press reporting, that was dominated by media giants, has been quickly shifted into an egalitarian environment where shock value and rapid reporting are paramount to success. Specifically, headlines and SEO key words dominate whether content is picked up by the all-important search engines.

This change has threatened the much-maligned trustworthiness of journalism since many companies now only focus on semi-inaccurate, but gripping headlines in hopes of staying financial viable and culturally relevant. And papers who hope to maintain levels of integrity, like The Daily Pennsylvanian, are punished by focusing on creating accurate-as-possible descriptions for their articles.

A solution to help combat this problem is provided by our DP SEO tool. In an attempt to help our company make its articles as accessible as possible while upholding our standards, we have designed an interface that takes in our previous articles data analytics, the DP writing style guide, and SEO optimization articles. With these vectors, our retrieval augmented generation (R.A.G.) and Claude Opus based interface can produce potential headlines, SEO key words, and other information that can best help support the reach and production of the DP's content.
